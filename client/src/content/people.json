This means that while we are targeting academic skills suited to each students’ individual levels and abilities, we are additionally working on social and communication skills, attending skills, life skills and more, in order for each of our children to live the most functional and independent life possible. We believe in the principles of ABA; they work, and we’ve seen amazing progress where others before had given up hope.\n\nIn addition to individualized teacher-made materials to reflect the precise needs of each students, we utilize 3 curriculums throughout our day and week. Handwriting Without Tears is used to teach 3 domains: math and numbers, literacy, and readiness and writing. Touch Math is used to teach higher mathematics skills. Together Counts is used to teach healthy eating and exercise principles. Many of the students, in this classroom, take the alternate assessment\n\nRoom 11 is a happy and busy classroom. Our staff is hard-working and enthusiastic, and we all truly love our students. \n\nAge Group:         7-10 Year Olds\n\nClass Size:            8:1:3",

We serve program and nursery school children from the ages of 3 to 5. Many of the students in this classroom will be transitioning to kindergarten within a year. We are an integrated classroom that is comprised of both children with special needs and nursery school children. Our classroom activities focus on the development of skills that will help each child be successful in elementary school and beyond.\n\nOur program is designed to provide students with hands on experiences that meet their individual needs and learning styles. Some of the skills we work on are social skills, daily living skills, attending skills, literacy, math, science exploration, social studies, and more. Hand Writing Without Tears and Touch Math are two of many tools we use to teach these skills. Every day is exciting in Room 5 as children and staff share new experiences that help us grow.",

This means that while we are targeting academic skills suited to each students’ individual levels and abilities, we are additionally working on social and communication skills, attending skills, life skills and more, in order for each of our children to live the most functional and independent life possible. We believe in the principles of ABA; they work, and we’ve seen amazing progress where others before had given up hope.\n\nIn addition to individualized teacher-made materials to reflect the precise needs of each students, we utilize 3 curriculums throughout our day and week. Handwriting Without Tears is used to teach 3 domains: math and numbers, literacy, and readiness and writing. Touch Math is used to teach higher mathematics skills. Together Counts is used to teach healthy eating and exercise principles. Many of the students, in this classroom, take the alternate assessment\n\nRoom 11 is a happy and busy classroom. Our staff is hard-working and enthusiastic, and we all truly love our students. \n\nAge Group:         7-10 Year Olds\n\nClass Size:            8:1:3",

We utilize techniques of Applied Behavior Analysis (individual visual schedules, individual instruction, least to most prompting, forward and backward chaining and task analysis) throughout our school day to assist in the acquisition and generalization of academic and social skills. In addition to these skills, there is also a large focus on developing self-regulation skills and coping skills. Other curriculum strategies such as Handwriting Without Tears and Touch Math, as well as music and arts and crafts are infused to help enhance and individualize our program. ",
